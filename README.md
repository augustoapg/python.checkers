# Python Checkers

This is a simple game of checkers created using Python with Pygame. The game contains an AI which uses minmax to determines its moves. This was made following the tutorial from Tech With Tim (link below):

# TODO:
- There is a bug where it does not allow a player to capture more than one piece if the first one is in its left and the second is in its right, or vice versa
- When the game ends, it simply closes. A winner message should show up
- There could be settings for the game, where the user chooses the color of the board and pieces, as well as chosing to play 2 player or against AI. Could also give the option to choose dificulty (AI's depth)
